Lecturer said to make a guess game wich work in console, but i wanted to use tkinter to build a user interface and make it more interesting,
and the result just suprised me and my colleagues.

I tried my best to catch all the possible errors, but it still has to be improved.

I would be glad to hear your suggestions.
